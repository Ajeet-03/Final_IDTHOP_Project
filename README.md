A secure image cryptographic system encrypts visual data to prevent unauthorized access. It uses advanced algorithms like AES or chaotic systems for pixel-level transformation. The system ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of image content. It's ideal for secure transmission, cloud storage, and privacy-focused image sharing.
